    </h1>

    <!-- Info from WHO to display on page -->
    <p id="influenza-info">
    Influenza, commonly called "the flu," is caused by viruses that infect the respiratory tract. Compared with most other
    respiratory infections, such as the common cold, the flu often causes a more severe illness.
    <br><br>
    Typical flu symptoms include fever (usually 100-103 degrees Fahrenheit in adults and often even higher in children) and
    respiratory symptoms, such as cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, as well as headache, muscle aches, and often
    extreme fatigue. Although nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can sometimes accompany the flu, especially in children,
    gastrointestinal symptoms are rare. The term "stomach flu" isn't really a flu at all. It's often used to describe an
    illness caused by other viruses.
    <br><br>
    Most people who get the flu recover completely in one to two weeks, but some people develop serious and potentially
    life-threatening medical complications, such as pneumonia. Because each flu season is different in length and severity,
    the number of serious illnesses and deaths that occur each year varies. In the past 30 years, the annual death rate from
    flu-related causes has ranged from 3,000 to 49,000 deaths per year. Flu-related complications can occur at any age;
    however, very young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with chronic health problems are much more likely
    to develop serious complications of the flu than are younger, healthier people.
